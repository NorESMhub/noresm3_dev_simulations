# noresm3_dev_simulations

The noresm3_dev_simulations repository is dedicated to **development of new cases for NorESM3** including for NorESM3 component models.

The idea for this repository was stolen shamelessly from the [NCAR amwg_dev repo](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev).

## To start a new development simulation, follow the Wiki instructions
