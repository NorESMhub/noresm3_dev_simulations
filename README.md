# noresmdev_case_config repo
The noresmdev_case_config repository is dedicated to development of new cases for NorESM including for NorESM component models.

The idea for this repository was stolen shamelessly from the [NCAR amwg_dev repo](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev).

## Development simulations: To start a new development case, follow these steps:
- Open a [New issue](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresmdev_case_config/issues/new/choose)
- Create a new branch with a name that describes the new case (e.g. add_interactive_pirates)
- Include a link to the branch in the issue (when pushed)
- Add an appropriate label (NorESM for fully-coupled cases, otherwise, the lead component model).
